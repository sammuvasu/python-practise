Variables:
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

#eg1;

Student = Vasu
print(student)

  #here Student = variable

  #and Vasu =  value

#eg2;


a, b, c = 17, 12, 1999

print(a,b,c)

#here a,b,c = variables and 17,12,1999 = values

Rules of  variables:
1. Variables can not start with digits and symbols
2. Variables should be meaningful
3. We can write alphanumeric values in variables
4.No space is allowed in variables
5. The characters allowed in Python variables are 
alphabets ( either upper or lower case)
digits (0-9)
and underscore( _ )
